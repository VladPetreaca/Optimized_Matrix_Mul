The expression is: C = B * A^t + A^2 * B, where
	- A, B are square matrices of size n*n
	- A is an upper triangulated matrix
	- A^t is the transpose of A
	- A^2 is a square matrix


solver_blas:
	- to calculate the expression, I declared 2 auxiliary matrices in which I copied the given matrix A and B using DCOPY from BLAS.
	- I calculated one by one using DTRMM: A^2 in a, A^2 * B in B, B * A^t in b.
	- finally, I added matrix B to b and returned it.

solver_neopt:
	- for this case, I defined a function that multiplies 2 matrices by 3 cases: (SQUARE - squaring an upper triangulated matrix), 
	(U_NORMAL - multiplication of an upper triangulated matrix with a normal one), (N_LOWER - multiplication a normal matrix with a lower triangulated matrix).
	- in addition to the multiplication function, I also defined another function that returns the transpose of a matrix.
	- finally, I declare one result matrix for each multiplication calculating the 2 terms of the addition and the sum.

solver_opt:
	- similar to the previous case
	- the difference is the use of pointers to access a specified zone of memory
	- thus, the number of additions and multiplications of the matrices descreases to calculate the addresses of the linearized matrices
